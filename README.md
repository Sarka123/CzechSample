## Goal of the study

This research project is based on the umbrella project "Pandemic Emergency in Social Perspective. Evidence from a large Web-survey research", designed and organized by principal investigators Linda Lombi (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan) and Marco Terraneo (Università Bicocca-Milano).

The principal goal of the international cross-sectional study is to explore the predictors of depression within the European context of the Covid-19 pandemic, specifically during the lockdown and social distancing period of March-April 2020.

Our team has decided to primarily focus on the impact of modifiable behavioral/lifestyle factors, such as exercise, alcohol and tobacco consumption, but, also, the usage of social media as a source of information about the pandemic. Our intention is to create and validate a depression model that these literature-based predictors should predict. Furthermore, we intend to explore the indirect pathway between social media consumption and depression mediated by the level of anxiety.

Supplementary data for this project, such as the survey questionnaire, original dataset and are accessible in our [Open Science Framework repository](https://osf.io/qs7zn/?view_only=91cf62078f614f519981d19d616c5644).
